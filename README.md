# Wine Quality Prediction
This project involves predicting the quality of wine using machine learning models. The goal is to classify wines based on their physicochemical properties and predict their quality on a scale. The project utilizes Python and various machine learning techniques to build and evaluate predictive models.
## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and preprocesses the wine dataset to make it suitable for model training.
- **Feature Engineering:** Selects and extracts relevant features to improve model performance.
- **Model Training:** Trains various machine learning models on the dataset to predict wine quality.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Prediction:** Classifies new wine samples based on trained models.
## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Core programming language used for the project.
- **Pandas:** Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** Library for numerical operations.
- **Scikit-Learn:** Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Libraries for data visualization.
